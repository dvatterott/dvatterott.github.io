The files in the source directory are the ones to edit if you want to make changes.

1. use codeblock syntax for code. The new interpreter (kramdown) doesn't like '''python - http://octopress.org/docs/plugins/codeblock/
  sed -i 's/```python/{% codeblock lang:python %}/g' test.md
  sed -i 's/```/{% endcodeblock %}/g' test.md
2  when using latex, i have to signal latex with 2 $$ instead of 1.
3. remember to update the image file locations
4. when calling sudo rake generate sudo loses the path to rake. this is some weird behavior definitely due to the hack job of ruby installations on my computer.
5. call source ~/.profile then i just have to use sudo env PATH=$PATH rake...

To fix (some of) the ruby problems, I have added a couple lines to ~/.bashrc. Now ruby is automatically in the path. I still have to use sudo env PATH=$PATH ...

Reminder on how to post
sudo env PATH=$PATH
rake new_post['title']
rake generate
#rake preview?? Then call the location in another terminal. I have a bookmark for this

make sure to run in terminal (not emacs terminal)
ruby --version (make sure 2.3.0)
rvm use 2.3.0

mkdir ~/octopress/public/_posts;
cp -r source/_includes/ public/_includes;
cp -r source/_posts/ public/_posts;
cp -rf ~/octopress/source/_posts/.directory ~/octopress/public/_posts/;

cd _deploy/
git push origin master --force

make sure CNAME is danvatterott.com

rake deploy
git add .
git commit -m 'message'
git push .

image example
<img src="{{ root_url }}/images/shotChart_martin.png" />
sed -i 's/!\[png\](/<img src="{{ root_url }}\/images\/roc_post\//g' 2018-03-17-exploring-roc-curves.markdown
sed -i 's/\(.png\))/\1" \/>/g' 2018-03-17-exploring-roc-curves.markdown

To start using RVM you need to run `source /home/dan-laptop/.rvm/scripts/rvm` or `source /etc/profile.d/rvm.sh`
    in all your open shell windows, in rare cases you need to reopen all shell windows.

In 10/2016 I installed kde neon. Not sure how much of this is true with the new install (I installed ruby with rvm... and this was easy, but still need more testing)
I changed the permissions so the sudo stuff is no longer required. Encountering other errors though...

It seems that I have to copy the posts folder into the public file. Not sure why, but its not hard to do. Just copy it over. Make sure just to post the _posts folder and the .directory file though. Not the other posts.

HOW TO INSTALL OCTOPRESS
+ http://octopress.org/docs/setup/
+ Google how to install RVM on ubuntu
+ Install ruby 2.3.0 NOT 1.9.3 (might have to install in root user). Note command to make rvm avail to use (source /etc/profile.d/rvm.sh)
+ Make sure using ruby 2.3.0 (ruby --version; rvm use 2.3.0 if not)
+ source /etc/profile.d/rvm.sh
+ gem install octopress (will require modifying the version of many gems... just do what the terminal says)
+ gem install bundler
+ bundle install (have to do in root even though it hates it)
