1. use codeblock syntax for code. The new interpreter (kramdown) doesn't like '''python - http://octopress.org/docs/plugins/codeblock/
2  when using latex, i have to signal latex with 2 $$ instead of 1. 
3. remember to update the image file locations
4. when calling sudo rake generate sudo loses the path to rake. this is some weird behavior definitely due to the hack job of ruby installations on my computer.
5. call source ~/.profile then i just have to use sudo env PATH=$PATH rake...

To fix (some of) the ruby problems, I have added a couple lines to ~/.bashrc. Now ruby is automatically in the path. I still have to use sudo env PATH=$PATH ...

Reminder on how to post 
rake generate
#rake preview?? Then call the location in another terminal. I have a bookmark for this
rake deploy
git add .
git commit -m 'message'
git push .
