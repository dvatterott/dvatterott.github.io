I'm a checklist addict. While our team has a document on acquiring different accounts, reviewing our workflows, reviewing code repos etc., this document doesn't provide any prioritization.

I created the following checklist (markdown) to give a condensed view of what a manager and new hire should accomplish by the end of the first week following a new hire's start.

I wasn't able to find existing onboarding checklists so I hope you find this useful!
