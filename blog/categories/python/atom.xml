    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I love doing data analyses with pandas, numpy, sci-py etc., but I often need to run <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeated_measures_design">repeated measures ANOVAs</a>, which are not implemented in any major python libraries. <a href="http://pythonpsychologist.tumblr.com/post/139246503057/repeated-measures-anova-using-python">Python Psychologist</a> shows how to do repeated measures ANOVAs yourself in python, but I find using a widley distributed implementation comforting&hellip;</p>

<p>In this post I show how to execute a repeated measures ANOVAs using the <a href="http://rpy2.bitbucket.org/">rpy2</a> library, which allows us to move data between python and R, and execute R commands from python. I use rpy2 to load the <a href="http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/car/docs/Anova">car</a> library and run the ANOVA.</p>

<p>I will show how to run a one-way repeated measures ANOVA and a two-way repeated measures ANOVA.</p>

<pre><code class="python">#first import the libraries I always use. 
import numpy as np, scipy.stats, pandas as pd

import matplotlib as mpl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pylab as pl
%matplotlib inline
pd.options.display.mpl_style = 'default'
plt.style.use('ggplot')
mpl.rcParams['font.family'] = ['Bitstream Vera Sans']
</code></pre>

<p>Below I use the random library to generate some fake data. I seed the random number generator with a one so that this analysis can be replicated.</p>

<p>I will generated 3 conditions which represent 3 levels of a single variable.</p>

<p>The data are generated from a gaussian distribution. The second condition has a higher mean than the other two conditions.</p>

<pre><code class="python">import random

random.seed(1) #seed random number generator
cond_1 = [random.gauss(600,30) for x in range(30)] #condition 1 has a mean of 600 and standard deviation of 30
cond_2 = [random.gauss(650,30) for x in range(30)] #u=650 and sd=30
cond_3 = [random.gauss(600,30) for x in range(30)] #u=600 and sd=30

plt.bar(np.arange(1,4),[np.mean(cond_1),np.mean(cond_2),np.mean(cond_3)],align='center') #plot data
plt.xticks([1,2,3]);
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/images/rmANOVA_1.png" /></p>

<p>Next, I load rpy2 for ipython. I am doing these analyses with ipython in a <a href="http://jupyter.org/">jupyter notebook</a> (highly recommended).</p>

<pre><code class="python">%load_ext rpy2.ipython
</code></pre>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how to run the ANOVA. Note that this is a one-way anova with 3 levels of the factor.</p>

<pre><code class="python">#pop the data into R
%Rpush cond_1 cond_2 cond_3 

#label the conditions
%R Factor &lt;- c('Cond1','Cond2','Cond3')
#create a vector of conditions
%R idata &lt;- data.frame(Factor) 

#combine data into single matrix
%R Bind &lt;- cbind(cond_1,cond_2,cond_3) 
#generate linear model
%R model &lt;- lm(Bind~1)

#load the car library. note this library must be installed.
%R library(car) 
#run anova
%R analysis &lt;- Anova(model,idata=idata,idesign=~Factor,type="III") 
#create anova summary table
%R anova_sum = summary(analysis) 

#move the data from R to python
%Rpull anova_sum 
print anova_sum
</code></pre>

    <link href="http://www.danvatterott.com/blog/2016/02/21/grouping-nba-players/"/>
    <updated>2016-02-21T15:14:23-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.danvatterott.com/blog/2016/02/21/grouping-nba-players</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In basketball, we typically talk about 5 positions: point guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward, and center. Based on this, one might expect NBA players to fall into 5 distinct groups- Point guards perform similar to other point guards, shooting guards perform similar to other shooting guards, etc. Is this the case? Do NBA players fall neatly into position groups?</p>

<p>To answer this question, I will look at how NBA players &ldquo;group&rdquo; together. For example, there might be a group of players who collect lots of rebounds, shoot poorly from behind the 3 point line, and block lots of shots. I might call these players forwards. If we allow player performance to create groups, what will these groups look like?</p>

<p>To group players, I will use k-means clustering (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering</a>).</p>

<p>When choosing a clustering algorithm, its important to think about how the clustering algorithm defines clusters. k-means minimizes the distance between data points (players in my case) and the center of K different points. Because distance is between the cluster center and a given point, k-means assumes clusters are spherical. When thinking about clusters of NBA players, do I think these clusters will be spherical? If not, then I might want try a different clustering algorithm.</p>

<p>For now, I will assume generally spherical clusters and use k-means. At the end of this post, I will comment on whether this assumption seems valid.</p>

<pre><code class="python">#import libraries and tell ipython we want inline figures rather than interactive figures. 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt, pandas as pd, numpy as np, matplotlib as mpl, requests, time

%matplotlib inline
pd.options.display.mpl_style = 'default' #load matplotlib for plotting
plt.style.use('ggplot') #im addicted to ggplot. so pretty.
mpl.rcParams['font.family'] = ['Bitstream Vera Sans']
</code></pre>

<p>We need data. Collecting the data will require a couple steps. First, I will create a matrix of all players who ever played in the NBA (via the NBA.com API).</p>

<pre><code class="python">url = 'http://stats.nba.com/stats/commonallplayers?IsOnlyCurrentSeason=0&amp;LeagueID=00&amp;Season=2015-16' 
# the critical part of the URL is IsOnlyCurrentSeason=0. The 0 means all seasons.
response = requests.get(url) #get data
headers = response.json()['resultSets'][0]
players = response.json()['resultSets'][0]['rowSet']
players_df = pd.DataFrame(players, columns=headers['headers']) #turn data into dataframe

<p>In the 1979-1980 season, the NBA started using the 3-point line. The 3-point has dramatically changed basketball, so players performed different before it. While this change in play was not instantaneous, it does not make sense to include players before the 3-point line.</p>

<pre><code class="python">players_df['TO_YEAR'] = players_df['TO_YEAR'].apply(lambda x:int(x)) #change data in the TO_YEAR column from strings to numbers
players_df = players_df[players_df['TO_YEAR']&gt;1979] #only use players after 3 pt line
</code></pre>

<p>I have a list of all the players after 1979, but I want data about all these players. When grouping the players, I am not interested in how much a player played. Instead, I want to know HOW a player played. To remove variability associated with playing time, I will gather data that is standardized for 36 minutes of play. For example, if a player averages 4 points and 12 minutes a game, this player averages 12 points per 36 minutes.</p>

<p>Below, I have written a function that will collect every player&rsquo;s performance per 36 minutes. The function collects data one player at a time, so its VERY slow. If you want the data, it can be found on my github (<a href="https://github.com/dvatterott/nba_project">https://github.com/dvatterott/nba_project</a>).</p>

<p>Great! Now we have data that is scaled for 36 minutes of play (per36 data) from every player between 1979 and 2016. Above, I printed out the columns. I don&rsquo;t want all this data. For instance, I do not care about how many minutes a player played. Also, some of the data is redundant. For instance, if I know a player&rsquo;s field goal attempts (FGA) and field goal percentage (FG_PCT), I can calculate the number of made field goals (FGM). I removed the data columns that seem redundant. I do this because I do not want redundant data exercising too much influence on the grouping process.</p>

<p>Below, I create new data columns for 2 point field goal attempts and 2 point field goal percentage. I also remove all players who played less than 50 games. I do this because these players have not had the opportunity to establish consistent performance.</p>

<pre><code class="python">df = df[df['GP']&gt;50] #only players with more than 50 games. 
df = df.fillna(0) #some players have "None" in some cells. Turn these into 0s
df['FG2M'] = df['FGM']-df['FG3M'] #find number of 2pt field goals
df['FG2A'] = df['FGA']-df['FG3A'] #2 point field goal attempts
df['FG2_PCT'] = df['FG2M']/df['FG2A'] #2 point field goal percentage
saveIDs = df['PLAYER_ID'] #save player IDs for later
df = df.drop(['PLAYER_ID','LEAGUE_ID','TEAM_ID','GP','GS','MIN','FGM','FGA','FG_PCT','FG3M','FTM','REB','PTS','FG2M'],1) #pull out unncessary columns
</code></pre>

<p>It&rsquo;s always important to visualize the data, so lets get an idea what we&rsquo;re working with!</p>

<p>The plot below is called a scatter matrix. This type of plot will appear again, so lets go through it carefully. Each subplot has the feature (stat) labeled on its row which serves as its y-axis. The column feature serves as the x-axis. For example the subplot in the second column of the first row plots 3-point field goal attempts by 3-point field goal percentage. As you can see, players that have higher 3-point percentages tend to take more 3-pointers&hellip; makes sense.</p>

<p>On the diagonals, I plot the Kernel Density Estimation for the sample histogram. More players fall into areas where where the line is higher on the y-axis. For instance, no players shoot better than ~45% from behind the 3 point line.</p>

<p>One interesting part about scatter matrices is the plots below the diagonal are a reflection of the plots above the diagonal. For example, the data in the second column of the first row and the first column of the second row are the same. The only difference is the axes have switched.</p>

<pre><code class="python">axs = pd.tools.plotting.scatter_matrix(df, alpha=0.2, figsize=(12, 12), diagonal='kde'); #the diagonal will show kernel density
[ax.set_yticks([]) for ax in axs[:,0]] #turn off the ticks that take up way too much space in such a crammed figure
[ax.set_xticks([]) for ax in axs[-1,:]];
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/images/scatter_mat1_nba.png" /></p>

<p>There are a couple things to note in the graph above. First, there&rsquo;s a TON of information there. Second, it looks like there are some strong correlations. For example, look at the subplots depicting offensive rebounds by defensive rebounds.</p>

<p>While I tried to throw out redundant data, I clearly did not throw out all redundant data. For example, players that are good 3-point shooters are probably also good free throw shooters. These players are simply good shooters, and being a good shooter contributes to multiple data columns above.</p>

<p>When I group the data, I do not want an ability such as shooting to contribute too much. I want to group players equally according to all their abilities. Below I use a PCA to seperate variance associated with the different &ldquo;components&rdquo; (e.g., shooting ability) of basketball performance.</p>

<p>For an explanation of PCA I recommend this link - <a href="https://georgemdallas.wordpress.com/2013/10/30/principal-component-analysis-4-dummies-eigenvectors-eigenvalues-and-dimension-reduction/.">https://georgemdallas.wordpress.com/2013/10/30/principal-component-analysis-4-dummies-eigenvectors-eigenvalues-and-dimension-reduction/.</a></p>

<pre><code class="python">from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.preprocessing import scale

X = df.as_matrix() #take data out of dataframe
X = scale(X) #standardize the data before giving it to the PCA. 
#I standardize the data because some features such as PF or steals have lower magnitudes than other features such as FG2A
#I want both to contribute equally to the PCA, so I make sure they're on the same scale.

<p>On the left, I plot the amount of variance explained after including each additional PCA component. Using all the components explains all the variability, but notice how little the last few components contribute. It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to include a component that only explains 1% of the variability&hellip;but how many components to include!?</p>

<p>I chose to include the first 5 components because no component after the 5th explained more than 5% of the data. This part of the analysis is admittedly arbitrary, but 5% is a relatively conservative cut-off.</p>

<p>Below is the fun part of the data. We get to look at what features contribute to the different principle components.</p>

<ul>
<li>Assists and 3-point shooting contribute to the first component. I will call this the <strong>Outside Skills</strong> component.</li>
<li>Free throw attempts, assists, turnovers and 2-point field goals contribute to the second component. I will call this the <strong>Rim Scoring</strong> component.</li>
<li>Free throw percentage and 2-point field goal percentage  contribute to the third component. I will call this the <strong>Pure Points</strong> component.</li>
<li>2-point field goal percentage and steals contribute to the fourth component. I will call this the <strong>Defensive Big Man</strong> component.</li>
<li>3-point shooting and free throws contribute to the fifth component. I will call this the <strong>Dead Eye</strong> component.</li>
</ul>


<p>One thing to keep in mind here is that each component explains less variance than the last. So while 3 point shooting contributes to both the 1st and 5th component, more 3 point shooting variability is probably explained by the 1st component.</p>

<p>It would be great if we had a PCA component that was only shooting and another that was only rebounding since we typically conceive these to be different skills. Yet, there are multiple aspects of each skill. For example, a 3-point shooter not only has to be a dead-eye shooter, but also has to find ways to get open. Additionally, being good at &ldquo;getting open&rdquo; might be something akin to basketball IQ which would also contribute to assists and steals!</p>

<pre><code class="python">factor_names = ['Outside Skills','Rim Scoring','Pure Points','Defensive Big Man','Dead Eye'] #my component names
loadings_df = pd.DataFrame(pca.components_, columns=df.columns)
#loadings_df[0:5] #all the factor loadings appear below.
</code></pre>

<p>Cool, we have our 5 PCA components. Now lets transform the data into our 5 component PCA space (from our 13 feature space - e.g., FG3A, FG3_PCT, ect.). To do this, we give each player a score on each of the 5 PCA components.</p>

<p>Next, I want to see how players cluster together based on their scores on these components. First, let&rsquo;s investigate how using more or less clusters (i.e., groups) explains different amounts of variance.</p>

<pre><code class="python">from scipy.spatial.distance import cdist, pdist, euclidean
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn import metrics


#http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6645895/calculating-the-percentage-of-variance-measure-for-k-means
#The above link was helpful when writing this code.

reduced_data = PCA(n_components=5, whiten=True).fit_transform(X) #transform data into the 5 PCA components space
#kmeans assumes clusters have equal variance, and whitening helps keep this assumption.

k_range = range(2,31) #looking amount of variance explained by 1 through 30 cluster
k_means_var = [KMeans(n_clusters=k).fit(reduced_data) for k in k_range] #fit kmeans with 1 cluster to 30 clusters

#get labels and calculate silhouette score
labels = [i.labels_ for i in k_means_var]
sil_score = [metrics.silhouette_score(reduced_data,i,metric='euclidean') for i in labels]

centroids = [i.cluster_centers_ for i in k_means_var] #get the center of each cluster
k_euclid = [cdist(reduced_data,cent,'euclidean') for cent in centroids] #calculate distance between each item and each cluster center
dist = [np.min(ke,axis=1) for ke in k_euclid] #get the distance between each item and its cluster

wcss = [sum(d**2) for d in dist] #within cluster sum of squares

plt.ylabel('Average Silhouette Score*100');
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/images/cluster_eval_nba.png" /></p>

<p>As you can in the left hand plot, adding more clusters explains more of the variance, but there are diminishing returns. Each additional cluster explains a little less data than the last (much like each PCA component explained less variance than the previous component).</p>

<p>The particularly intersting point here is the point where the second derivative is greatest, when the amount of change changes the most (the elbow). The elbow occurs at the 6th cluster.</p>

<p>Perhaps not coincidently, 6 clusters also has the highest silhouette score (right hand plot). The silhouette score computes the average distance between a player and all other players in this player&rsquo;s cluster. It then divides this distance by the distance between this player and all players in the next nearest cluster. Silhouette scores range between -1 and 1 (where negative one means the player is in the wrong cluster, 0 means the clusters completely overlap, and 1 means the clusters are extermely well separated).</p>

<p>Six clusters has the highest silhouette score at 0.19. 0.19 is not great, and suggests a different clustering algorithm might be better. More on this later.</p>

<p>Because 6 clusters is the elbow and has the highest silhouette score, I will use 6 clusters in my grouping analysis. Okay, now that I decided on 6 clusters lets see what players fall into what clusters!</p>

<pre><code class="python">final_fit = KMeans(n_clusters=6).fit(reduced_data) #fit 6 clusters
df['kmeans_label'] = final_fit.labels_ #label each data point with its clusters

player_names = [pd.DataFrame(players_df[players_df['PERSON_ID']==x]['DISPLAY_LAST_COMMA_FIRST']).to_string(header=False,index=False) for x in df['PLAYER_ID']]
# because playerID #s mean nothing to me, lets get the names too
df['Name'] = player_names

#lets also create a dataframe with data about where the clusters occur in the 5 component PCA space.
cluster_locs = pd.DataFrame(final_fit.cluster_centers_,columns=['component %s'% str(s) for s in range(np.size(final_fit.cluster_centers_,1))])
cluster_locs.columns = factor_names

<p>Awesome. Now lets see how all the clusters look. These clusters were created in 5 dimensional space, which is not easy to visualize. Below I plot another scatter matrix. The scatter matrix allows us to visualize the clusters in different 2D combinations of the 5D space.</p>

<p>In this plot above. I mark the center of a given cluster with an X. For example, Cluster 0 and Cluster 5 are both high in outside skills. Cluster 5 is also high in rim scoring, but low in pure points.</p>

<p>First, let me mention that cluster number is a purely categorical variable. Not ordinal. If you run this analysis, you will likely create clusters with similar players, but in a different order. For example, your cluster 1 might be my cluster 0.</p>

<p>Cluster 0 has the most players (25%; about 490 of the 1965 in this cluster analysis) and is red in the scatter matrix above.</p>

<p>Cluster 0 players are second highest in outside shooting (in the table above you can see their average score on the outside skills component is 0.83). These players are lowest in rim scoring (-0.93), so they do not draw many fouls - they are basically the snipers from the outside.</p>

<p>The prototype is Lloyd Daniels who takes a fair number of 3s. I wouldn&rsquo;t call 31% a dominant 3-point percentage, but its certainly not bad. Notably, Lloyd Daniels doesn&rsquo;t seem to do much but shoot threes, as 55% of his shots come from the great beyond.</p>

<p>Cluster 0 notable players include Andrea Bargnani, JJ Barea, Danilo Gallinari, and Brandon Jennings. Some forwards. Some Guards. Mostly good shooters.</p>

<p>On to Cluster 1&hellip; I probably should have made a function from this code, but I enjoyed picking the players pictures too much.</p>

<p>Cluster 1 is green in the scatter matrix and includes about 14% of players.</p>

<p>Cluster 1 is highest on the rim scoring, pure points, and Dead Eye components. These players get the ball in the hoop.</p>

<p>Christian Laettner is the prototype. He&rsquo;s a solid scoring forward.</p>

<p>Gilbert Arenas stands out in the first ten names as I was tempted to think of this cluster as big men, but it really seems to be players who shoot, score, and draw fouls.</p>

<p>Cluster 2 is yellow in the scatter matrix and includes about 17% of players.</p>

<p>Lots of big men who are not outside shooters and don&rsquo;t draw many fouls. These players are strong 2 point shooters and free throw shooters. I think of these players as mid-range shooters. Many of the more recent Cluster 2 players are forwards since mid-range guards do not have much of a place in the current NBA.</p>

<p>Cluster 2&rsquo;s prototype is Doug West. Doug West shoots well from the free throw line and on 2-point attempts, but not the 3-point line. He does not draw many fouls or collect many rebounds.</p>

<p>Cluster 2 noteable players include LaMarcus Aldridge, Tayshaun Prince, Thaddeus Young, and Shaun Livingston</p>

<p>Cluster 3 is blue in the scatter matrix and includes about 16% of players.</p>

<p>Cluster 3 players do not have outside skills such as assists and 3-point shooting (they&rsquo;re last in outside skills). They do not draw many fouls or shoot well from the free throw line. These players do not shoot often, but have a decent shooting percentage. This is likely because they only shoot when wide open next to the hoop.</p>

<p>Cluster 3 players are highest on the defensive big man component. They block lots of shots and collect lots of rebounds.</p>

<p>The Cluster 3 prototype is Kelvin Cato. Cato is not and outside shooter and he only averages 7.5 shots per 36, but he makes these shots at a decent clip. Cato averages about 10 rebounds per 36.</p>

<p>Notable Cluster 3 players include Andrew Bogut, Tyson Chandler, Andre Drummond, Kawahi Leonard??, Dikembe Mutumbo, and Hassan Whiteside.</p>

<p>Cluster 4 is cyan in the scatter matrix above and includes the least number of players (about 13%).</p>

<p>Cluster 4 players are not high on outsize skills. They are average on rim scoring. They do not score many points, and they don&rsquo;t fill up the defensive side of the stat sheet. These players don&rsquo;t seem like all stars.</p>

<p>Looking at Doug Edwards' stats - certainly not a 3-point shooter. I guess a good description of cluster 4 players might be &hellip; NBA caliber bench warmers.</p>

<p>Cluster 4&rsquo;s notable players include Yi Jianlian and Anthony Bennet&hellip;.yeesh</p>

<p>Cluster 5 is magenta in the scatter matrix and includes 16% of players.</p>

<p>Cluster 5 players are highest in outside skills and second highest in rim scoring yet these players are dead last in pure points. It seems they score around the rim, but do not draw many fouls. They are second highest in defensive big man.</p>

<p>Gerald Henderson Sr is the prototype. Henderson is a good 3 point and free throw shooter but does not draw many fouls. He has lots of assists and steals.</p>

<p>Of interest mostly because it generates an error in my code, Gerald Henderson Jr is in cluster 2 - the mid range shooters.</p>

<p>Notable cluster 5 players include Mugsy Bogues, MCW, Jeff Hornacek, Magic Johnson, Jason Kidd, Steve Nash, Rajon Rando, John Stockton. Lots of guards.</p>

<p>In the cell below, I plot the percentage of players in each cluster.</p>

<pre><code class="python">plt.clf()
plt.hist(df['kmeans_label'], normed=True,bins=[0,1,2,3,4,5,6],rwidth = 0.5)
plt.xticks([0.5,1.5,2.5,3.5,4.5,5.5],['Group 0','Group 1','Group 2','Goup 3','Group 4','Group 5'])
plt.ylabel('Percentage of Players in Each Cluster');

<p><img src="/images/cluster_inc_nba.png" /></p>

<p>I began this post by asking whether player positions is the most natural way to group NBA players. The clustering analysis here suggests not.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s my take on the clusters: Cluster 0 is pure shooters, Cluster 1 is talented scorers, Cluster 2 is mid-range shooters, Cluster 3 is defensive big-men, Cluster 4 is bench warmers, Cluster 5 is distributors. We might call the &ldquo;positions&rdquo; shooters, scorers, rim protectors, and distributors.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s possible that our notion of position comes more from defensive performance than offensive. On defense, a player must have a particular size and agility to guard a particular opposing player. Because of this, a team will want a range of sizes and agility - strong men to defend the rim and quick men to defend agile ball carriers. Box scores are notoriously bad at describing defensive performance. This could account for the lack of &ldquo;positions&rdquo; in my cluster.</p>

<p>I did not include player height and weight in this analysis. I imagine height and weight might have made clusters that resemble the traditional positions. I chose to not include height and weight because these are player attributes; not player performance.</p>

<p>After looking through all the groups one thing that stands out to me is the lack of specialization. For example we did not find a single cluster of incredible 3-point shooters. Cluster 1 includes many great shooters, but it&rsquo;s not populated exclusively by great shooters. It would be interesting if adding additional clusters to the analysis could find more specific clusters such as big-men that can shoot from the outside (e.g., Dirk) or high-volume scorers (e.g., Kobe).</p>

<p>I tried to list some of the aberrant cluster choices in the notable players to give you an idea for the amount of error in the clustering. These aberrant choices are not errors, they are simply an artifact of how k-means defines clusters. Using a different clustering algorithm would produce different clusters. On that note, the silhouette score of this clustering model is not great, yet the clustering algorithm definitely found similar players, so its not worthless. Nonetheless, clusters of NBA players might not be spherical. This would prevent a high silhouette score. Trying a different algorithm without the spherical clusters assumption would definitely be worthwhile.</p>

<p>Throughout this entire analysis, I was tempted to think about group membership, as a predictor of a player&rsquo;s future performance. For instance, when I saw Karl Anthony Towns in the same cluster as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, I couldn&rsquo;t help but think this meant good things for Karl Anthony Towns. Right now, this doesn&rsquo;t seem justified. No group included less than 10% of players so not much of an oppotunity for a uniformly &ldquo;star&rdquo; group to form. Each group contained some good and some bad players. Could more clusters change this? I plan on examining whether more clusters can improve the clustering algorithm&rsquo;s ability to find clusters of exclusively quality players. If it works, I&rsquo;ll post it here.</p>

    <updated>2015-12-22T14:21:06-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.danvatterott.com/blog/2015/12/22/creating-nba-shot-charts</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here I create shot charts depicting both shooting percentage and the number of shots taken at different court locations, similar to those produced on Austin Clemens' website (<a href="http://www.austinclemens.com/shotcharts/">http://www.austinclemens.com/shotcharts/</a>).</p>

<p>To create the shooting charts, I looked to a post by Savvas Tjortjoglou (<a href="http://savvastjortjoglou.com/nba-shot-sharts.html">http://savvastjortjoglou.com/nba-shot-sharts.html</a>). Savvas' post is great, but his plots only depict the number of shots taken at different locations.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m interested in both the number of shots AND the shooting percentage at different locations. This requires a little bit more work. Here&rsquo;s how I did it.</p>

<pre><code class="python">#import some libraries and tell ipython we want inline figures rather than interactive figures. 
%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt, pandas as pd, numpy as np, matplotlib as mpl
</code></pre>

<p>First, we have to acquire shooting data about each player. I retrieved the data from NBA.com&rsquo;s API using code from Savvas Tjortjoglou&rsquo;s post.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t show you the output of this function. If you&rsquo;re interested in the details, I recommend Savvas Tjortjoglou&rsquo;s post.</p>

<pre><code class="python">def aqcuire_shootingData(PlayerID,Season):
    import requests
    shot_chart_url = 'http://stats.nba.com/stats/shotchartdetail?CFID=33&amp;CFPARAMS='+Season+'&amp;ContextFilter='\
                    '&amp;ContextMeasure=FGA&amp;DateFrom=&amp;DateTo=&amp;GameID=&amp;GameSegment=&amp;LastNGames=0&amp;LeagueID='\
                    '00&amp;Location=&amp;MeasureType=Base&amp;Month=0&amp;OpponentTeamID=0&amp;Outcome=&amp;PaceAdjust='\
                    'N&amp;PerMode=PerGame&amp;Period=0&amp;PlayerID='+PlayerID+'&amp;PlusMinus=N&amp;Position=&amp;Rank='\
                    'N&amp;RookieYear=&amp;Season='+Season+'&amp;SeasonSegment=&amp;SeasonType=Regular+Season&amp;TeamID='\
                    '0&amp;VsConference=&amp;VsDivision=&amp;mode=Advanced&amp;showDetails=0&amp;showShots=1&amp;showZones=0'
    response = requests.get(shot_chart_url)
    headers = response.json()['resultSets'][0]['headers']
    shots = response.json()['resultSets'][0]['rowSet']
    shot_df = pd.DataFrame(shots, columns=headers)
    return shot_df
</code></pre>

<p>Next, we need to draw a basketball court which we can draw the shot chart on. This basketball court has to use the same coordinate system as NBA.com&rsquo;s API. For instance, 3pt shots have to be X units from hoop and layups have to be Y units from the hoop. Again, I recycle code from Savvas Tjortjoglou (phew! figuring out NBA.com&rsquo;s coordinate system would have taken me awhile).</p>

<pre><code class="python">def draw_court(ax=None, color='black', lw=2, outer_lines=False):

    court_elements = [hoop, backboard, outer_box, inner_box, top_free_throw,
                      bottom_free_throw, restricted, corner_three_a,

        court_elements.append(outer_lines)

    for element in court_elements:

    ax.set_yticks([])
    return ax
</code></pre>

<p>We want to create an array of shooting percentages across the different locations in our plot. I decided to group locations into evenly spaced hexagons using matplotlib&rsquo;s hexbin function (<a href="http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html">http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html</a>). This function will count the number of times a shot is taken from a location in each of the hexagons.</p>

<p>The hexagons are evenly spaced across the xy grid. The variable &ldquo;gridsize&rdquo; controls the number of hexagons. The variable &ldquo;extent&rdquo; controls where the first hexagon and last hexagon are drawn (ordinarily the first hexagon is drawn based on the location of the first shot).</p>

<p>Computing shooting percentages requires counting the number of made and taken shots in each hexagon, so I run hexbin once using all shots taken and once using only the location of made shots. Then I simply divide the number of made shots by taken shots at each location.</p>

<pre><code class="python">def find_shootingPcts(shot_df, gridNum):
    x = shot_df.LOC_X[shot_df['LOC_Y']&lt;425.1] #i want to make sure to only include shots I can draw
    y = shot_df.LOC_Y[shot_df['LOC_Y']&lt;425.1]

    x_made = shot_df.LOC_X[(shot_df['SHOT_MADE_FLAG']==1) &amp; (shot_df['LOC_Y']&lt;425.1)]
    y_made = shot_df.LOC_Y[(shot_df['SHOT_MADE_FLAG']==1) &amp; (shot_df['LOC_Y']&lt;425.1)]

    #compute number of shots made and taken from each hexbin location
    hb_shot = plt.hexbin(x, y, gridsize=gridNum, extent=(-250,250,425,-50));
    plt.close() #don't want to show this figure!
    hb_made = plt.hexbin(x_made, y_made, gridsize=gridNum, extent=(-250,250,425,-50),cmap=plt.cm.Reds);
    plt.close()

    #compute shooting percentage
    ShootingPctLocs = hb_made.get_array() / hb_shot.get_array()
    ShootingPctLocs[np.isnan(ShootingPctLocs)] = 0 #makes 0/0s=0
    return (ShootingPctLocs, hb_shot)
</code></pre>

<p>I really liked how Savvas Tjortjoglou included players' pictures in his shooting charts, so I recycled this part of his code too. The picture will appear in the bottom right hand corner of the shooting chart</p>

<pre><code class="python">def acquire_playerPic(PlayerID, zoom, offset=(250,400)):
    from matplotlib import  offsetbox as osb
    import urllib
    pic = urllib.urlretrieve("http://stats.nba.com/media/players/230x185/"+PlayerID+".png",PlayerID+".png")
    player_pic = plt.imread(pic[0])
    img = osb.OffsetImage(player_pic, zoom)
    #img.set_offset(offset)
    img = osb.AnnotationBbox(img, offset,xycoords='data',pad=0.0, box_alignment=(1,0), frameon=False)
    return img
</code></pre>

<p>I want to depict shooting percentage using a sequential colormap - more red circles = better shooting percentage. The &ldquo;reds&rdquo; colormap looks great, but would depict a 0% shooting percentage as white (<a href="http://matplotlib.org/users/colormaps.html">http://matplotlib.org/users/colormaps.html</a>), and white circles will not appear in my plots. I want 0% shooting to be slight pink, so below I modify the reds colormap.</p>

<pre><code class="python">#cmap = plt.cm.Reds

<p>Okay, now lets put it all together. The large function below will use the functions above to create a shot chart depicting shooting percentage as the color of a circle (more red = better shooting %) and the number of shots as the size of a circle (larger circle = more shots). One note about the circle sizes, the size of a circle can increase until they start to overlap. When they start to overlap, I prevent them from growing.</p>

<p>In this function, I compute the shooting percentages and number of shots at each location. Then I draw circles depicting the number of shots taken at that location (circle size) and the shooting percentage at that location (circle color).</p>

<pre><code class="python">def shooting_plot(shot_df, plot_size=(12,8),gridNum=30):
    from matplotlib.patches import Circle
    x = shot_df.LOC_X[shot_df['LOC_Y']&lt;425.1]
    y = shot_df.LOC_Y[shot_df['LOC_Y']&lt;425.1]

    #compute shooting percentage and # of shots
    (ShootingPctLocs, shotNumber) = find_shootingPcts(shot_df, gridNum)

    #draw figure and court
    fig = plt.figure(figsize=plot_size)#(12,7)
    cmap = mymap #my modified colormap
    ax = plt.axes([0.1, 0.1, 0.8, 0.8]) #where to place the plot within the figure
    draw_court(outer_lines=False)
    plt.xlim(-250,250)
    plt.ylim(400, -25)

    #draw player image
    zoom = np.float(plot_size[0])/(12.0*2) #how much to zoom the player's pic. I have this hackily dependent on figure size
    img = acquire_playerPic(PlayerID, zoom)
    ax.add_artist(img)

    #draw circles
    for i, shots in enumerate(ShootingPctLocs): 
        restricted = Circle(shotNumber.get_offsets()[i], radius=shotNumber.get_array()[i],
                            color=cmap(shots),alpha=0.8, fill=True)
        if restricted.radius &gt; 240/gridNum: restricted.radius=240/gridNum
        ax.add_patch(restricted)

    #draw color bar
    ax2 = fig.add_axes([0.92, 0.1, 0.02, 0.8])
    cb = mpl.colorbar.ColorbarBase(ax2,cmap=cmap, orientation='vertical')
    cb.set_label('Shooting %')
    cb.set_ticks([0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0])
    cb.set_ticklabels(['0%','25%', '50%','75%', '100%'])

    plt.show()

<p>One concern with my plots is the use of hexbin. It&rsquo;s a bit hacky. In particular, it does not account for the nonlinearity produced by the 3 point line (some hexbins include both long 2-pt shots and 3-pt shots). It would be nice to limit some bins to 3-pt shots, but I can&rsquo;t think of a way to do this without hardcoding the locations. One advantage with the hexbin method is I can easily change the number of bins. I&rsquo;m not sure I could produce equivalent flexibility with a plot that bins 2-pt and 3-pt shots seperately.</p>

<p>Another concern is my plots treat all shots as equal, which is not fair. Shooting 40% from the restricted area and behind the 3-pt line are very different. Austin Clemens accounts for this by plotting shooting percentage relative to league average. Maybe I&rsquo;ll implement something similar in the future.</p>

    <id>http://www.danvatterott.com/blog/2015/12/12/complete-amnesia-for-object-attributes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Reanalysis of Chen &amp; Wyble, 2015</h3>

<p>Chen and Wyble published an interesting paper (2015) where they demonstrate that participants cannot report attributes of attended stimuli unless the participants are previously informed that this attribute is important. For instance, you wouldn&rsquo;t remember the color of the apple if you had had just told someone the shape. I would have expected the opposite, so &hellip; cool!</p>

<p>After reading the paper (you can check it out at <a href="http://wyblelab.com/publications">http://wyblelab.com/publications</a>), I became curious whether participants might unconsciously retain some information about these forgotten attributes. Chen and Wyble posted their data to databrary.com (<a href="https://nyu.databrary.org/volume/79">https://nyu.databrary.org/volume/79</a>), so I downloaded the data and did some quick analyses that you see here! I want to commend Chen and Wyble for sharing their data. This is something everyone should start doing (including me).</p>

<p>Below, I will start by showing I can replicate Chen and Wyble&rsquo;s analyses, then I will investigate whether there&rsquo;s a trace of unconscious memory for the &ldquo;forgotten&rdquo; features.</p>

<p>EDIT[12/22/15]:
Brad Wyble recently pointed out that I overstated the claim in their paper. They do not claim participants have complete amnesia for unqueried object attributes. Rather, Chen and Wyble focus on the dramatic performance change between the first and second trial following the initial query about an object attribute. This performance change demonstrates amnesia, but not necessarily complete amnesia.</p>

<h4>Load relevant libraries and write analysis functions</h4>

<p>I want to create a new variable.</p>

<p>Before explaining the new variable, I should explain a little about Chen and Wyble&rsquo;s experiment. Half the participants were instructed to find the letter among numbers and the other half were instructed to find the number among letters. 4 items were briefly flashed on the screen (150 ms) then participants reported where the target item had been. Each of the 4 items was a different color.</p>

<p>Participants reported target location for 155 trials. On the 156th trial, the participants reported the target location then (to their surprise) reported what specific letter/number the target was and what color it was. Even though participants knew where the target was, they had no idea what either the target&rsquo;s letter/number or color were. They had &ldquo;forgotten&rdquo; what the target was (even though they must have known what the target was when they initially located it).</p>

<p>The new variable will code whether the trial is a &ldquo;pre-surprise&rdquo; trial (trials 1-155), a surprise trial (trial 156) or the trial after the surprise (trial 157).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll call this variable &ldquo;TrialType&rdquo;</p>

<p>TrialType: 0=Presurprise; 1=Surprise Trial; 2=Postsurprise trials.</p>

<pre><code class="python">df['TrialType'] = np.where(df['Trial#']&lt;156, 0, np.where(df['Trial#']==156, 1, 2))
df['TrialType2'] = np.where(df['Trial#']&lt;156, 0, np.where(df['Trial#']==156, 1, np.where(df['Trial#']==157, 2, -1)))

<h4>Experiment 1: Replicating Chen &amp; Wyble&rsquo;s (2015) analyses</h4>

<p>Lets just take a quick look at overall accuracy. Make sure everyone is doing ok on the task. Below I plot the mean accuracy of each participant&hellip;looks like participant 23 struggled a little. Chen and Wyble (2015) notes that no participants were excluded or replaced.</p>

<p>I might have replaced participant 23 since his/her accuracy is easily 2.5 standard deviations below the mean accuracy (I print this value below)&hellip;seems like participant 23 was doing something different in this task.</p>

<pre><code class="python">tableAcc = df.pivot_table(values='Loc_Acc', index='Sub#', aggfunc=np.mean)
#print tableAcc
print 'mean accuracy'
print np.round(np.mean(tableAcc),2)
print 'standard deviation of accuracies'
print np.round(np.std(tableAcc),2)

print '2.5 standard deviations below mean accuracy'
print np.round(np.mean(tableAcc)-2.5*np.std(tableAcc),2)

tableAcc.plot(ylim = [0, 1], kind='bar');
</code></pre>

<pre><code>mean accuracy
0.89
standard deviation of accuracies
0.07
2.5 standard deviations below mean accuracy
0.71
</code></pre>

<p>Lets look at participants' performance when asked to identify the target&rsquo;s location. I will plot performance as mean accuracy in the presurprise,surprise, and postsurprose trials.</p>

<p>I will also run some quick statistical tests. For these tests, I take the arcsine of the square root of the accuracies (Rao, 1960) to increase the accuracies' normality (I use adj. to indiciate that the tested data is transformed). I test whether this worked with a Shapiro-Wilk test of normality. If the p-value of the Shapiro-Wilk test is greater than 0.1, I run a t test to see if the accuracy in the two conditions is significantly different. If the p-value of the Shapiro-Wilk test is less than or equal to 0.1, then I run a Wilcoxon signed rank test since this test does not care about normality.</p>

<p>The y-axis represents percent correct. All graphs in this post will have percent correct on the y-axis.</p>

<p>Replicating Chen and Wyble, participants perform no worse in the surprise and post surprise trials, indicating that they succesfully found the target.</p>

<p>Now lets look at participants' ability to report the target&rsquo;s color in the surprise trial and the trial immediately following the surprise test.</p>

<p>Below I plot the percent of participants that correctly identified the target&rsquo;s color in the surprise and post-surprise trials</p>

<pre><code class="python">Trial_Trimmer = df['TrialType2'] &gt; 0

<p>We perfectly replicate Chen and Wyble; participants respond more accurarely in the post-surprise trial than in the surprise trial.</p>

<p>The next cell examines participants' ability to report the target&rsquo;s identity on the surprise trial and the trial immediately following the surprise trial. Remember, the participants locate the target based on whether its a letter or number, so they know the broad category of the target. Nonetheless, they cannot report the target&rsquo;s identity on the surprise trial</p>

<pre><code class="python">Trial_Trimmer = df['TrialType2'] &gt; 0

<h4>Experiment 1 - Intertrial analyses</h4>

<p>So far, I&rsquo;ve perfectly replicated Chen &amp; Wyble (which is good since this is their data).</p>

<p>Now I want to see if the target&rsquo;s color or identity on the previous trial influences the current trial&rsquo;s performance in the location task. I am only examining presurprise trials, so this should be trials when the participants don&rsquo;t &ldquo;remember&rdquo; the target&rsquo;s color or identity.</p>

<p>First I want to make some variables representing whether the target&rsquo;s color and identity repeat across trials.</p>

<pre><code class="python">df['Prev_TarCol'] = df['TarCol'].shift(periods=1)
df['Prev_TarCol_match'] = np.where(df['Prev_TarCol']==df['TarCol'], 1, 2)
df['Prev_Iden'] = df['Tar_Iden'].shift(periods=1)
df['Prev_Iden_match'] = np.where(df['Prev_Iden']==df['Tar_Iden'], 1, 2)
df['Prev_Col+Iden_match'] = np.where((df['Prev_Iden_match']==1) &amp; (df['Prev_TarCol_match']==1), 1, 2)
</code></pre>

<p>Lets see what happens when the target&rsquo;s color and identity repeat.</p>

<pre><code class="python">Trial_Trimmer = df['TrialType'] == 0
ColandIden_Acc1 = df[Trial_Trimmer].pivot_table(values='Loc_Acc', index='Sub#', columns='Prev_Col+Iden_match',
                                                aggfunc=np.mean)
CIs = SimpleComparisonCI(ColandIden_Acc1)
Analysis_and_Plot_3(ColandIden_Acc1, CIs)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>---------------------------------
Mean match: 0.918
Mean mismatch: 0.8925
Match - Mismatch: 0.0255
---------------------------------
Match vs Mismatch
     normality test adj. Test value: 0.92 P-value: 0.0821
     Wilcoxon. Test value: 51.0 P-value: 0.04
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/images/Wyble5.png" /></p>

<p>Looks like a 2.5% increase in accuracy. Now, this wasn&rsquo;t really a planned comparison, so please take this result with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>As a sanity check, lets look at how repetitions in the target&rsquo;s location (the reported feature) effect performance.</p>

<p>We have to quickly create a new variable coding target location repetitions</p>

<pre><code class="python">df['Prev_Loc'] = df['Tar_Loc'].shift(periods=1)
df['Prev_Loc_match'] = np.where(df['Prev_Loc']==df['Tar_Loc'], 1, 2)
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="python">Trial_Trimmer = df['TrialType'] == 0
Loc_Acc1 = df[Trial_Trimmer].pivot_table(values='Loc_Acc', index='Sub#', columns='Prev_Loc_match', aggfunc=np.mean)
CIs = SimpleComparisonCI(Loc_Acc1)
Analysis_and_Plot_3(Loc_Acc1, CIs)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>---------------------------------
Mean match: 0.9101
Mean mismatch: 0.8883
Match - Mismatch: 0.0218
---------------------------------
Match vs Mismatch
     normality test adj. Test value: 0.93 P-value: 0.1812
     T-test adj. Test value: 2.62 P-value: 0.0168
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/images/Wyble6.png" /></p>

<p>Target location repetitions lead to a 2% increase in performance. Again, this result is robust.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a good sign that this effect is about the same size as repetitions in the unreported features.</p>

<h3>Replicate Experiments 1 Intertrial Analyses with Experiment 1b</h3>

<p>Experiment 1 had some evidence that participants unconsciously knew the color and identity of the target, since they performed a little better when the color and identity repeated. The effect was small, so I am not 100% confident that it&rsquo;s robust.</p>

<p>The best way to demonstrate that this effect is real would be to show that it also exists in another similar Experiment. Chen and Wyble provide a replication of Experiment 1. In this experiment, the only difference is the target and distractors appear for longer and are not masked (making them easier to see).</p>

<p>If participants response more accurately when the target color and identity repeat in Experiment 1b, then we can be a little more confident that participants are unconsciously aware of the target&rsquo;s color and identity.</p>

<pre><code class="python">filename = 'Exp1b.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(filename)
df.columns = ['Sub#', 'Block', 'Trial#', 'TarCol', 'Tar_Iden','Tar_Loc', 'Col_Resp', 'Iden_Resp', 'Loc_Resp', 
             'Col_Acc', 'Iden_Acc', 'Loc_Acc'] #naming the columns of the data file.

df['TrialType'] = np.where(df['Trial#']&lt;156, 0, np.where(df['Trial#']==156, 1, 2))
df['TrialType2'] = np.where(df['Trial#']&lt;156, 0, np.where(df['Trial#']==156, 1, np.where(df['Trial#']==157, 2, -1)))

df['Prev_TarCol'] = df['TarCol'].shift(periods=1)
df['Prev_TarCol_match'] = np.where(df['Prev_TarCol']==df['TarCol'], 1, 2)
df['Prev_Iden'] = df['Tar_Iden'].shift(periods=1)
df['Prev_Iden_match'] = np.where(df['Prev_Iden']==df['Tar_Iden'], 1, 2)

                                               columns='Prev_Col+Iden_match', aggfunc=np.mean)

<p>Wow. Only a 1% change in accuracy, so again not big. Nonetheless, this result is signficant. So, Some evidence that participants perform a little better when the targets' color and identity repeat.</p>

<p>This suggests that participants retain some information about the targets' color and identity even though they cannot explicitly report these attributes.</p>

<p>Now, I would probably want to replicate this result again before trusting it, but I&rsquo;m relatively confident that participants unconsciously retain some information about the target&rsquo;s color and identity.</p>
